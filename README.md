Part 3:

Tasks:

1 - Eddy
2 - Eimaan
3 - Eimaan
4 - Eimaan
5 - Eddy
6 - Eddy



























Part 2 -DONE!

Deadlines:

1)
  Subfunctions:
a. motorW - Eddy DONE!
b. rover_dynamics - Eddy DONE!
c. mechpower - Eimaan
d. battenergy - Eimaan
e. simulate_rover - Eddy/Eimaan

DUE Feb 24

  Scripts:
a. experiment_visualization.py  - Eddy
b. efficiency_visualization.py - Eimaan
c. rover_experiment1.py - Eddy/Eimaan as needed

DUE Mar 12

2) Write up for Task 2, 5, 8, and 9 in a file called Project2.pdf. - Eddy/Eimaan
3) Collaboration statement, in a file called collaboration.pdf. Inform us if you - Eddy/Eimaan
have consulted with any other teams or generative AI tools on this project.

6) All of your function files from Phase 2 must contain comments regarding the - Eddy/Eimaan
function description (one sentence is fine) as well as function inputs and
outputs that will display when “help(<fname>)” is typed in the command
line.

7) All of your Python files (functions and scripts) from Phase 2 should be - Eddy/Eimaan
thoroughly commented, making it clear what every calculation is meant to
achieve. You do not need to go back and comment Phase 1 functions, unless
you want to. For example, in get_gear_ratio from Phase 1, a useful comment
for a calculation would be something like:
# Compute gear ratio using the pinion and gear diameters
Ng = (d2/d1)**2

DUE Mar 19


FINAL DUE: Mar 26
